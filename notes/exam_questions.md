# Exam questions

## 1.1 We have looked at some static analysis tools like StyleCop, PMD, FindBugs and SonarLint. Explain how static analysis can improve code quality. Explain how it helped you or could have helped you in your project.

Static testing is checking for defects in software before execution of program.

static testing is code reviews and pair programming we implemented. 
static analysis we used linters to help os make more optimizable, improveble and maintainable code.  

In static testing, we used linters for our project. linters helped us improve code quality and helped optimized the code. 
- improve maintainability. -> implementing code standards. 
- code reliability. -> like undefined and unchanged variable.
- code optimization -> Performance for unused imports. extra time for execution.

types: 
- Manual examinations -> Manually meaning done by a human, (Testing Reviews)
- Automated analysis using tools -> analysis done by tools automatically. (Linters)

Reviews
- Inspections 
- Walkthroughs
- Technical reviews
- Informal reviews

why Static Testing?
- Early defects detection and correction
- Reduced development timescales
- Reduced testing cost and time
- For improvement of development productivity
- To get fewer defect at a later stage of testing

## Explain test levels, and what characterizes the infividual levels. Then, relate to your own project.

#### Static Testing
**characteristics**
- Test will be done before the execution of the program.
- Test both code and associated documentation. 
- Helps detects errors before code executions


#### Unit testing
- 

#### Integration Testing
#### System Testing
#### Load Testing
#### Acceptance Testing
